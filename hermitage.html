            Haystack Mountain’s ski slopes offer a wide variety of terrain with the comfort and familiarity of a neighborhood park. Haystack Mountain first opened in 1964 as a less crowded alternative to busy Vermont ski areas -- a goal we still maintain today.

            Haystack main mountain offers something for everyone, from long winding greens and blues, to steep blacks. It also has a number of glades to fill your need for tree skiing. The main mountain is serviced by a 6-person high speed lift with protective bubbles and heated seats. This offers a welcome respite from the weather, while also getting you up the mountain quickly.
            
            The main mountain’s northern peak, The Witches, is a playground dedicated to experts. It is serviced by a dedicated lift, allowing you to ski steeps all day long, with no lift lines. The Witches also includes advanced glades to challenge even the best tree skiers. 
            
            Haystack’s lower mountain includes a number of beginner runs serviced by a dedicated chair, giving beginners a range of options to hone their skills. Our lower mountain also includes a growing terrain park where you can perform all your favorite tricks. 
            
            The hub of our mountain is our member clubhouse. With lockers for all your ski equipment, there is no need to haul heavy gear to and from the mountain. Just leave your car with the valet, and change in the comfort of the locker rooms. Your skis were put out for you before you arrived, so you are moments from the slope. The clubhouse also offers a range of meal options, full bar, and more.
